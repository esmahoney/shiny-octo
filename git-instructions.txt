Git Steps

Here are step by step instructions to starting your own project.

1. create a repository on Github
2. clone the repository:
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd <repo-name>
3. Update a file:
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd <repo-name>
4. Add a new file to the directory:
    echo "Hello Git practice" > practice.txt
5. Check changes:
    git status
    git diff README.md
6. Create a branch:
    git git switch -c branch-1
    or
    git checkout -b feature/practice-update (creates a new branch and switches to the branch)
7. Stage and commit the changes
    git add README.md practice.txt
    git commit -m "docs: update README and add practice file"
8. Push changes to remote repository
    git push -u origin feature/practice-update
9. View changes in Github.
10. Create pull request
11. tag reviewers.
12. when reviews are approved, merge to main.


Additional helpful instructions:

To check if you are on the right branch: 
    git remote -v
To see what branch you are on:
    git branch --show-current
Check upstream tracking
    git status
To change to another remote repository:
    git remote set-url origin <correct-repo-url>
To direct yoour branch to the right upstream:
    git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/feature/practice-update

Installing and using GitHub CLI:

1. gh --version (to verify if you have GitHub CLI installed)
2. brew install gh (ask homebrew to install if needed)
3. gh auth login (to connect your github acct to the client. This will prompt you to answer a couple questions and then login with the web browser with a one-time code.)

To create a PR from the command line:
(note you will need to make sure you have GitHub CLI and Homebrew can do that for you)
gh pr create --base main --head <branch-name> --repo <username/repo-name>

From here you should be able to see your PR in Github.
